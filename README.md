# Event-Extraction-from-Tweets

This repository contains code for extracting events from tweets using Named Entity Recognition (NER). The goal is to identify and classify specific events mentioned in the tweets. The code is implemented as a Flask API, allowing users to interact with the event extraction model.
I have used 2 datasets. One larger(234MB) another smaller(1.54MB).
